# Bioinformatics Python Lab 🧬

Welcome to my learning journey! This repository contains Python scripts I developed to solve biological problems.

### 🚀 Projects Included:
* **DNA Nucleotide Counter:** Calculates the frequency of A, C, G, and T in a given sequence (Rosalind Challenge).
* **Smart Gene Validator:** A script that checks for Start Codons (ATG) and analyzes GC Content stability using nested logic.
* **Genetic Filter Tool:** Filters DNA sequences based on quality scores and nucleotide composition.

### 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated:
* Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets).
* Conditional Logic (If-Elif-Else & Nested If).
* Bioinformatics Concepts (GC Content, Start Codons, Mutations).
